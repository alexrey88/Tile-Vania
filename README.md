# Tile-Vania

## Overview

This platformer game was built using Unity version 2021.3.28f1. The majority of the code was developed while following the Udemy course [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/learn/lecture/28711454?start=675#overview). However, the codebase was then refactored to improve maintainability (notable changes include breaking down the code into smaller functions and adding null reference verifications).

## Features

The following features were added outside of the course, showcasing additional creative development beyond the original tutorial content:

- **Moving Platform:** Added functionality for dynamic platforms that move.

- **Apple Object:** Introduced an apple object that, when collected, makes the player character move backward and collect more coins.
  
- **Secret Door:** Implemented a secret door feature, enhancing the exploration aspect of the game.

- **Enhanced Sound Effects:** Expanded the audio experience with additional sound effects for actions such as bouncing and enemy eliminations for a more immersive gaming experience.
